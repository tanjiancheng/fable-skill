  multi-step requests that a direct attempt handles fine. Operational guardrails

# Fable Mode

This skill encodes execution discipline for complex work: decompose before acting,
delegate where the runtime allows, verify with checks that can fail, self-critique
before delivery.

A note on what this is. The skill shapes the *procedure* a model follows. It does not
change the model's underlying capability. Coherence across long tasks and genuine
self-correction live in the weights, not in a prompt. On a model that already does
these well, the skill reinforces good habits. On a weaker model, it imposes structure
the model would otherwise skip, but it cannot lift the model's reasoning ceiling. Treat
this as a checklist, not a capability transplant.

## When NOT to use this

If a task has one obvious correct approach and fits in a single pass, do it directly and
skip this loop. Staging a trivial task wastes effort and buries the answer under
ceremony. This loop earns its cost only when a one-shot attempt would plausibly miss
something.

## Calibrate to the model running it

The loop's value inverts with model strength. Apply it at the right intensity:

- **Frontier-tier models (Fable/Mythos class, latest Opus).** These plan, verify, and
  self-correct natively. Do NOT narrate the loop or write a formal stage map for tasks
  the model would handle cleanly anyway — that is ceremony. Apply only: (a) the failable-
  check standard from step 3 when producing artifacts, and (b) the Operational rules
  below. Write a full stage map only for genuinely multi-session or many-file work.
  An explicit trigger phrase (肥波模式 / fable mode) activates the discipline, not the
  ceremony: it does not override this calibration.
- **Sonnet-tier.** Run the full loop. Sonnet plans decently but reliably skips step 3 —
  the check that can fail — and substitutes "looks right" review. Enforce step 3 hardest.
- **Haiku-tier.** Run the full loop with tightened checks: every stage gets a failable
  check, no stage may be marked unverified without naming what check was impossible and
  why. Haiku under time pressure skips verification entirely; the loop exists to prevent
  exactly that. Accept that the ceiling is unchanged — Haiku with a checklist is still
  Haiku. Escalate to a stronger model rather than looping when the task needs synthesis
  the checks can't substitute for.

If the model cannot tell which tier it is, assume Sonnet-tier and run the full loop.

## Core Loop

The loop is constant across domains. Only the verification artifact in step 3 changes by
domain (see Domain-specific patterns).

**1. Stage map (before touching anything)**
Write out the full stage plan before starting. Number the stages. Include a brief
expected output for each. This is how you avoid discovering at stage 7 that you made a
wrong assumption at stage 2. Update the map when what you learn invalidates what you
planned. The map is a living document, not a contract.

Each stage should produce one verifiable artifact. If a stage produces nothing checkable,
merge it with the next.

**Replan budget.** A living document is not an excuse to churn. Allow at most two full
replans per run. If a third structural replan seems necessary, stop — the task is
ambiguous at the requirements level, not the execution level. Surface the ambiguity to
the user and get a decision before burning more stages. Renumbering or splitting a single
stage does not count as a replan; reordering or rewriting the map does.

Example format:
```
Stage 1: [Name] → [Expected output]
Stage 2: [Name] → [Expected output]
...
```

**2. Delegate independent work (if the runtime supports it)**
First check whether subagent tooling exists (Cursor: Task tool; Claude Code: Agent/Task
tool). If it does not, run the stages sequentially and proceed to step 3.

If subagent tooling is available and stage N and stage M don't depend on each other,
spawn them concurrently. Route by cost and user preference — check the runtime's **allowed
model list first**; slugs are exact strings, bare names like `"sonnet"` fail on Cursor.

| Intent | Cursor (Task tool) | Claude Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Balanced / thorough sub-work (default) | Newest `claude-sonnet-*` slug (e.g. `claude-sonnet-5-thinking-high`) | `model: "sonnet"` |
| Cheap / fast sub-work | Cheapest fast-tier slug (e.g. `composer-2.5-fast`; no Haiku-class slug on Cursor) | `model: "haiku"` |
| Peak synthesis sub-work | Strongest slug available | `model: "opus"` or inherit |

If the user says "用 sonnet 跑" / "cheap" / "fast" / "on haiku", honor that when picking
the subagent model. If the requested tier isn't in the allowed list, pick the closest match,
state the substitution in your report, and proceed — do not block.

Each subagent briefing must include: its specific task, expected output, where to save
results, relevant context from prior stages, the **Core Loop steps 1–4** from this skill,
and the **Operational rules** below verbatim — a spawned subagent cannot see this skill.

Good delegation: "research X while I do Y", "process these 3 files", "verify this
independently". Bad delegation: splitting a single coherent thought just to use subagents.

Keep delegation one level deep by default: a spawned subagent runs its stages sequentially
rather than spawning its own subagents. Nesting multiplies cost and scatters context —
allow a second level only when a sub-part clearly needs its own fan-out.

**3. Verify with a check that can fail**
Each stage must define a pass condition that an external artifact satisfies. Acceptable
checks:
- a test that runs and passes
- a file or output that provably exists in the expected shape
- a source actually fetched and read, not assumed
- an output diffed against the stated spec

"I reviewed it and it looks right" is not a check. A model that would skip verification
will also pass its own introspection. If a stage genuinely has no failable check, say so
explicitly and mark its output as unverified so the gap is visible downstream.

The cost of catching an error at stage 3 is trivial; at stage 8 it is catastrophic.

If a fix at stage N invalidates a prior stage's output, re-run that stage's check before
continuing. The loop goes forward and backward.

**4. Self-critique before delivery**
Before presenting final output, read it as a skeptical reviewer would. Hunt for a real
weakness or limitation; if one exists, fix it or flag it to the user. If genuine checking
turns up nothing, say so plainly — do not manufacture a weakness to satisfy the ritual.
Step 3 is the check that can fail. Step 4 is the judgment call about what remains weak
after the check passes.

Verify-before-flag and warning batching rules for this step are in the Operational
rules section below and are mandatory.

## Domain-specific patterns

Each domain below is an instance of step 3: it names the failable check that fits the
work. The check must name the exact command, file, or comparison — "verified" without a
named artifact is a step-3 violation.

### Software engineering
- Read the entire relevant codebase section before writing a line. Failable check:
  list the files actually opened; any file the diff touches that isn't on the list is a
  gap.
- Write tests before (or alongside) implementation, not after.
- For large changes: plan the diff, then execute it.
- Failable check: named test command runs and passes; at least one error path exercised
  and its output shown, not just the happy path. A test suite that was never run does
  not count as passing.

### Research / knowledge work
- Gather sources before synthesizing. Do not write as you search.
- For each claim that matters: what's the evidence? what would falsify it?
- Distinguish confirmed facts from inferences; flag the latter explicitly.
- Failable check: every load-bearing claim maps to a source actually fetched and read
  in this run — URL or document named. A claim resting on training memory alone must be
  labeled as such. Absence of a web result is never itself a finding (see
  verify-before-flag in Operational rules).

### Data analysis
- Understand the data shape before writing any analysis: row count, column list, and
  a sample printed, not assumed.
- State your hypothesis before computing, not after seeing the numbers.
- Failable check: quality assertions (null counts, duplicate keys, out-of-range values,
  total row count vs. source) run against the actual data with output shown. Any
  aggregate in the deliverable reconciles to a spot-checked raw slice — pick one
  subtotal and recompute it independently.

### Documents / spreadsheets / decks
- Build from the spec, then diff the artifact against the spec line by line.
- Failable check: open the produced file and read it back — every required section,
  number, and label confirmed present. For spreadsheets: subtotals recomputed from raw
  rows match the report; formats (currency, headers) spot-checked on the rendered file,
  not the generating code.

### Long-running / multi-session tasks
- Maintain a work log: decisions made, why, what was tried and failed.
- At the start of any continuation, re-read the work log before doing anything.
- Define done criteria upfront so you know when to stop.
- Failable check: done criteria are written and testable, not vibes; each continuation
  begins with a line confirming the log was re-read and naming any decision it changed.

## Operational rules (always-on, every model, every task)

These three rules apply whether or not the staged loop is running. They are behavioral
contracts with the user, not capability aids. When spawning subagents, inline them into
the briefing verbatim — a subagent cannot see this skill.

**1. Verify before flag.** Before flagging any problem, verify it actually exists: grep,
diff, run it, or check the source directly. An unverified flag — a warning raised because
evidence wasn't *found*, rather than because a fault was *found* — is itself an error; it
manufactures doubt and sends the user chasing ghosts. Web silence is never grounds for a
warning against the user's firsthand information. A capability flag ("this may be beyond
me") follows the same standard: name what was attempted and where it failed.

**2. Warning threshold.** Minor concerns accumulate across a run. Keep a running count;
at the threshold (default three, user-tunable), stop and surface all of them at once
before continuing — one interruption with full context beats three fragmentary ones. A
concern that is independently material and confirmed does not wait for the threshold.

**3. Find-and-replace safety.** Anchor sed/substring replaces on word boundaries
(`\bword\b`, never bare `word` — a bare `edge` replace mangles `Ledger`). Preferred
order: targeted string-replace on a unique anchor > word-boundary sed > bare sed
(never). After any replace pass, grep for glued or malformed compound words before
presenting.

## What this skill doesn't do

It doesn't make the underlying model smarter. Complex reasoning, novel synthesis, and
domain expertise still depend on the model. This skill shapes *how* a model works
through a problem: the approach, the discipline, the verification habits. It does not
change raw capability.

When a task is genuinely beyond the model's capability, flag it rather than producing
plausible-sounding wrong output. That flag must itself follow verify-before-flag: name
what was attempted and where it failed, not a vague appeal to difficulty.
